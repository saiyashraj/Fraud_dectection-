# Fraud_dectection-
This a ml-model to dectect a fraud 
# ðŸ’³ Fraud Detection Web App

This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether a financial transaction is potentially fraudulent. The model used is a Logistic Regression classifier trained with a full preprocessing pipeline that includes scaling and encoding.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
- Accepts transaction inputs like type, amount, sender/receiver balances
- Uses a trained machine learning pipeline for prediction
- Displays whether the transaction is **fraudulent** or **legitimate**

## ðŸ§  Model Info

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression (`class_weight='balanced'`)
- **Preprocessing**: 
  - `StandardScaler` for numeric features
  - `OneHotEncoder` for categorical features (drop='first')
- **Pipeline**: Entire pipeline (preprocessor + classifier) saved as `fraud_detection.pkl`
